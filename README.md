A Basic React App that takes Dad Jokes from an API and saves them to your local browser storage. So all the jokes remain until you restart the browser. The jokes and the voting data will remain even if you hard refresh. 
    With cool animations to make it more user friendly.
    
    This is just a practice project btw.
